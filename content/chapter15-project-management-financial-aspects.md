2. Work breakdown structure (WBS) provides hierarchical decomposition of project scope
3. Critical path method (CPM) identifies activities that affect project duration
4. Different project management methodologies (PMBOK, PRINCE2, Agile) offer various approaches
5. Resource management involves allocation, leveling, and smoothing
6. Cost management includes estimation, budgeting, and control with earned value management
7. Procurement involves planning, RFI/RFP/RFQ processes, and contract management
8. Risk management encompasses identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring
9. Quality management includes planning, assurance, and control activities

## Practice Questions

1. What are the five process groups in PMBOK?
2. Explain the difference between resource leveling and resource smoothing.
3. What is the formula for calculating Cost Performance Index (CPI)?
4. Name four risk response strategies.
5. What does the 100% rule mean in Work Breakdown Structure creation?

## Answers

1. The five process groups in PMBOK are: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
2. Resource leveling adjusts start and finish dates to optimize resource allocation and may extend project duration, while resource smoothing moves activities within float to maintain resource levels without extending project duration.
3. The formula for Cost Performance Index (CPI) is: CPI = Earned Value (EV) / Actual Cost (AC).
4. The four risk response strategies are: Avoid (eliminate threat), Transfer (shift responsibility), Mitigate (reduce probability/impact), and Accept (acknowledge and take no action).
5. The 100% rule in WBS creation means that each level of decomposition represents 100% of the work contained in the parent level, with no overlap or duplication of work across branches.
